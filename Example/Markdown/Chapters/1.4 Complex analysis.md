%% > The rules of algebra show that the square of any number, whether positive of negative, is a positive number: therefore, to speak of the square root of a negative number is mere absurdity. Now, Cardan^[Gerolamo Cardano (1501–1576)] deliberately commits that absurdity and begins to calculate on such "imaginary" quantities. One would describe this as pure madness; and yet the whole development of algebra and analysis would have been impossible without that fundament–-which, of course, was, in the nineteenth century, established on solid and rigorous bases. It has been written that the shortest and best way between two truths of the real domain often passes through the imaginary one.

So far we have introduced generating functions as purely formal objects and demonstrated how its algebraic structure directly reflects the structure of combinatorial classes. 
However, to uncover the true power of this central concept in lattice path enumeration, we need to examine it in the light of analysis. 
Hence, in this section we will introduce the basic concepts and theorems that form the framework of this complex-analytic examination. 
Unless otherwise stated, the definitions and theorems introduced in this section can be found in the book \[[[Funktionentheorie Eine Einführung Sechste Auflage|Jänich, 2004]]\] by Jänich.

An important property of holomorphic functions is that not a lot of information about them is necessary in order to uniquely characterize them, as the following theorem demonstrates.

Further, it should be noted that the notions of analyticity and holomorphy are equivalent. One direction of this equivalence can be demonstrated via Cauchy's^[Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789–1857)] coefficient formula.

Even though all the series expansions at $0$ of the generating functions we study in this thesis will not contain any terms with negative exponents, the theory of power series alone cannot yet suffice, if we want to derive asymptotic results about the growth of the series coefficients.
In Section [[2.3 Singularity analysis]] we will present an introduction into singularity analysis, where we will show how the location and nature of a generating functions dominant singularity determines the asymptotic growth of its corresponding counting sequence.
The simplest case to analyze is a generating function with exactly one simple pole on its radius of convergence. If we want to observe the behavior of the function around this polar singularity, a Laurent^[Pierre Alphonse Laurent (1813–1854)] series expansion is the method of choice.

As power series correspond to local expansions of holomorphic functions, Laurent series are similarly local expansions of meromorphic function.

Cauchy's coefficient formula can then be extended to Laurent series.

Finally, the theory of coefficient extraction using contour integrals culminates in the famous residue theorem named after Cauchy.

The cornerstone on which we will build the important theorems of singularity analysis is Newton's generalized binomial theorem that generalizes the classical binomial theorem to arbitrary complex exponents.

Further, we will need a complex version of a well known result in real analysis.

We close this synopsis over the complex-analytic methods used throughout this thesis with an important algebraic elimination technique.
In many cases, generating functions are only accessible as solutions to algebraic equations. For higher degrees this means that closed-form solutions are often infeasible, if not straight-up impossible.
Say we derived a formula for a generating function like $E(z) = -\frac{u_1(z) u_2(z)}{z}$, with $u_1(z), u_2(z)$ being solutions of an algebraic equation $K(z,u)$. Can we derive an algebraic equation satisfied by $F(z)$?

This question can be positively answered with the help of *resultants*, as they provide a way to eliminate auxiliary quantities from systems of polynomial equations.
