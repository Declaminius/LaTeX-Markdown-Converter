In Chapter [[1 Introduction]] we provide the necessary framework with the basics of combinatorial structures and complex analysis, along with a perspective on the historical developments of this field. In Chapter [[2 Directed lattice paths and the kernel method]] we study directed lattice paths and give a thorough introduction to the kernel method, essential for deriving their generating functions. In Chapter [[3 Basketball walks]] we specialize the general formulae derived in the previous chapter to a subclass of directed lattice paths, called *basketball walks*, after the evolution of the score of a basketball game before the introduction of the 3-point rule. Next, in Chapter [[4 Lattice paths with catastrophes]] we study an extension of the theory of directed lattice paths, where we allow additional steps, so-called *catastrophes* that reset the lattice path back to the $x$-axis. We compare and contrast two different models of catastrophes in terms of their generating functions and the asymptotic growth rates of the respective counting sequences. Finally, in Chapter [[5 Links to other combinatorial problems]] we provide bijections between lattice paths with catastrophes and directed animals.
