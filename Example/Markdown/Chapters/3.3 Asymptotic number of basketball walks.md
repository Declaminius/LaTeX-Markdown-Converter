In this section we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the exactly enumerated sequences from the previous sections.

In addition to the asymptotic results presented in \[[[Explicit formulas for enumeration of lattice paths basketball and the kernel method|Banderier et. al., 2019]]\], we present the asymptotic growth rate of the number of basketball excursions and compare them to the previously derived asymptotics in Table [[Table of coefficients of different basketball walks]].
