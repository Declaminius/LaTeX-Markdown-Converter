This section gives an introduction into the theory of counting animals, including the quite lengthy definition of stacked directed animals, together with their generating functions and corresponding asymptotic behavior. 
The presentation of these results follows the excellent article by Bousquet-Mélou and Rechnitzer \[[[Lattice animals and heaps of dimers|Bousquet-Mélou & Rechnitzer, 2002]]\]. 
Once we have established the necessary groundwork to understand these combinatorial objects, we will present a novel bijective procedure in Subsection [[5.1.2 Bijection to Motzkin excursions with alternative catastrophes]], linking this subclass of polyominoes to the class of Motzkin excursions with alternative catastrophes.

The motivation behind the enumeration of such lattice animals or polyominoes can be found in the study of branched polymers \[[[Statistics of collapsing lattice animals|Flesia et. al., 1994]]\] and percolation \[[[On two-dimensional percolation|Conway & Guttmann, 1995]]\]. 
However, even though these combinatorial objects have been studied for more than 40 years, exact enumeration results for general polyominoes are still rare. 
Thus, one of the main research directions focuses on the investigation of large subclasses of polyominoes that are exactly enumerable. 
This is also the motivating force behind the class of stacked directed animals that we will define in this section.

The polyominoes we care about in this section have square or hexagonal cells, as illustrated in Figure [[Figure. Polyominoes and matching lattice animals]]. 
We start now with the definition of a subclass of polyominoes that has already been exactly enumerated by Dhar in \[[[Equivalence of the two-dimensional directed-site animal problem to Baxter's hard-square lattice-gas model|Dhar, 1982]]\].

The easiest description for the class of stacked directed animals, however, does not build directly upon the above definition. 
Instead, it defines them indirectly via a one-to-one correspondence to a natural class of heaps of dimers, which are a powerful tool in the enumeration of directed animals. 
These heaps are simple combinatorial structures first introduced by Viennot \[[[Problèmes combinatoires posés par la physique statistique|Viennot, 1985]]\]. 
This new approach greatly simplifies the derivation of the corresponding generating function and also serves as an intermediary step for our bijection to Motzkin excursions with alternative catastrophes.

Now we will describe a construction from \[[[Lattice animals and heaps of dimers|Bousquet-Mélou & Rechnitzer, 2002, p.~240]]\] that maps directed animals on the square lattice to strict pyramids of dimers, as well as directed animals on the triangular lattice to general pyramids of dimers.

Thus, $V$ maps lattice animals to connected heaps and in the case of triangular lattice animals, the following construction will show that the mapping is even surjective.

We will now finally define the class of stacked directed animals as a subclass of multi-directed animals that is easier to enumerate.

> [!definition]+ Stacked directed animals
> ![[Stacked directed animals|no-title]]

These lattice animals are easier to enumerate due to their recursive description. This description translates easily into algebraic equations for their generating functions, and will also prove to be vital for the construction of our correspondence to the set of Motzkin excursions with alternative catastrophes.
