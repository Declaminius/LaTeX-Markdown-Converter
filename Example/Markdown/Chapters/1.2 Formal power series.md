As generating functions of counting sequences are the central mathematical object of combinatorial analysis, we need to introduce a few basic concepts about polynomial rings from algebra.

The formal topology is a useful tool to analyze the convergence of some combinatorial constructions that go beyond a finite number of arithmetic operations.
