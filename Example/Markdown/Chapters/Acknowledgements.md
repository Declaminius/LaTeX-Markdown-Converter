First and foremost I want to thank my supervisor, Michael Wallner,
for introducing me to the field of lattice path combinatorics and for passing on his contagious excitement for the topic.
Not only did he have a fitting answer to all of my questions, but he was also able to point me in exciting new directions with his questions to me. Furthermore, he ensured a high standard of quality with detailed corrections right to the end.

Next, I would also like to thank my colleagues Fabian Zehetgruber and Paul Winkler, whose helpful comments have noticeably improved this thesis.

Last but not least, I would like to thank my family for actively supporting and believing in me throughout my studies.
