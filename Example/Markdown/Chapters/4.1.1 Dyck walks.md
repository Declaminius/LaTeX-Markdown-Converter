We start with the classical example in lattice path enumeration, the family of Dyck walks corresponding to the simple step set $\mathcal{D} = \{-1,1\}$.

Now we follow these results up with two simple bijections to related classes of lattice paths listed in the respective [$\texttt{OEIS}$](https://oeis.org) entries.

For further bijections, Baril and Kirgizov \[[[Bijections from Dyck and Motzkin meanders with catastrophes to pattern avoiding Dyck paths|Baril & Kirgizov, 2021, Theorem 1]]\] have also constructed a bijection between the set of Dyck meanders of length $n$ with catastrophes and the set of Dyck excursions of length $2n$ having no occurrence of the patterns **NE-NE-NE** and **SE-NE-SE** at height $h > 0$, highlighting the diverse connections between different families of lattice paths. To conclude this subsection, we present the counting sequences of Dyck excursions with (alternative) catastrophes.
