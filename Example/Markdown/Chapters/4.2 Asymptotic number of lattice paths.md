In this section we work out the asymptotic behavior of the sequences derived in the previous sections. To derive asymptotics of coefficients of generating functions, singularity analysis is the way to go. A central theme in this process is the search for singularities of the function. In the easiest case, there is exactly one singularity on the radius of convergence.
However, when considering periodic step sets, we have to deal with the periodically distributed singularities on the circle of convergence. In this case, all of these singularities need to be handled with care, as cancellations might occur. In this thesis, however, we will not delve into these technical details and restrict ourselves to the analysis of aperiodic step sets.
For a full treatment on how to deduce the asymptotics of walks having periodic jump polynomials from the results on aperiodic ones, we refer to \[[[The kernel method for lattice paths below a line of rational slope|Banderier & Wallner, 2019, Lemma 8.7 and Theorem 8.8]]\] from Banderier and Wallner.

These periodicities play a crucial role in the process of singularity analysis, as they contribute additional singularities periodically distributed on the disk of convergence.

As a first step towards deriving the asymptotics of meanders and excursions with catastrophes, we start by analyzing the function $D(z) = 1/(1-Q(z))$, since it is a crucial building block in all of the generating functions. For that we need to find its singularities. They are either zeroes of $1 - Q(z)$ or singularities of $Q(z)$. Since
$$
Q(z) = q z\Bigg(M(z) - E(z) - \sum_{\substack{s > 0, \\ -s\in \mathcal{S}}} M_s(z)\Bigg)
$$
we have to analyze the singularities of the components $M(z), E(z)$ and $M_s(z)$. For that, the results of \[[[Basic analytic combinatorics of directed lattice paths|Banderier & Flajolet, 2002, Theorem~3, Theorem~4]]\] show that the components $M(z), M_s(z)$ and $E(z)$ have exactly one dominant singularity.
However, there is a caveat: Even if we already know the radii of convergence $\rho_M,\rho_E,\rho_{M_s}$ of $M(z), E(z), M_s(z)$, respectively, it is a priori not granted that $Q(z)$ does not have a larger radius of convergence, since some cancellations could occur. 
Therefore we need to look at the asymptotics of their coefficients and argue that they make such cancellations impossible.
The asymptotics depend on a quantity called the drift of a walk.

> ![[Drift|no-title]]

Firstly we note that, as long as no cancellations occur, the dominant singularity will be at $\rho_M$, as the coefficients of $M(z)$ dominate the coefficients of the functions $E(z)$ and $M_s(z)$.
For a positive drift $\delta > 0$, the results in \[[[Basic analytic combinatorics of directed lattice paths|Banderier & Flajolet, 2002, Theorem 3, Theorem 4]]\] show that $$
M(z) \sim C \cdot P(1)^n \gg D_s \cdot P(\tau)^n \sim E(z), M_s(z).
$$
Hence, the dominant singularity at $\rho_M = 1/P(1)$ cannot be cancelled by the other functions.
For $\delta \leq 0$ the growth rates of the coefficients are all of the same exponential order $P(\tau)^n$. In particular, the coefficients for all $M_s(z), s > 0$ are of the same order. Since $\mathcal{S}$ is finite, $Q(z)$ is by definition the sum of an infinite number of $M_s(z)$, and consequently, its coefficients cannot have a lower exponential growth rate.
Thus the dominant singularity has to remain at $\rho_M = 1/P(\tau)$.
Therefore the radius of convergence of $Q(z)$ is given by $\rho_Q = \rho_M$. 
We now determine the radius of convergence $\rho_D$ of $D(z)$.

The above considerations about periodicity are only necessary when the dominant asymptotics come from the singularity $\rho_Q$.
When $\rho_0 < \rho$, we have a unique dominant simple pole originating from $M(z)$ and the possibly periodic functions $E(z)$ and $M_s(z)$ cannot contribute additional dominant singularities. 
This polar behavior occurs for Dyck paths, as we will see in Corollary [[Corollary 4.2.8]].

Further, the results from Theorem [[Theorem 4.2.5]] also hold for the generating function of excursions ending with alternative catastrophes with $Q(z) = zM(z)$, since the now missing components $E(z)$ and $M_s(z)$ do not contribute relevant singularities in the proof.
The following theorems about the asymptotics of meanders and excursions are thus stated with a generic function $Q(z)$ and hold both for catastrophes and alternative catastrophes.

Let us now apply the theorems to derive the asymptotics of the families of lattice paths with alternative catastrophes considered in the previous section.

There appears to be a pattern pertaining the asymptotic growth rates of $k$-Motzkin walks (with Dyck walks appearing as $0$-Motzkin walks) and the results for $2$-Motzkin walks continue to fall in line with it.
