In this section, we present a concise introduction to the general approach to the analysis of coefficients of generating functions. We will base our exposition on the excellent presentation on this topic by Flajolet and Sedgewick in \[[[Analytic combinatorics|Flajolet & Sedgewick, 2009, Chapter VI]]\].

Through the lens of complex analysis a generating function becomes a geometric transformation of the complex plane. While this transformation is very regular at the origin, when we move away from it, singularities start to appear that distort this smooth picture. As it turns out, the nature and the location of a function's singularities hold the key for determining the asymptotic growth rates of the coefficients. Precisely, the method of singularity analysis applies to functions, whose singular expansion involves fractional powers and logarithms. In order not to clutter the important conceptual points with tedious technical details, we will restrict our attention to only fractional powers and give notice whenever the results may be generalized to so-called "algebraic-logarithmic" singularities. The process relies on two central ingredients:

1. A catalogue of asymptotic expansions for coefficients of the standard functions that occur in such singular expansions.
2. Transfer theorems, which allow us to extract the asymptotic order of coefficients of error terms in singular expansions.

Before we introduce the catalogue known as the *standard function scale*, let us return to the basics for a second.
Remember the Newton expansion
$$
(1 - z)^{-\alpha} = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \binom{n + \alpha - 1}{n} z^n.
$$
For $\alpha = r \in \Z_{\geq 1}$ this quickly leads to the asymptotic formula
$$
[z^n](1 - z)^{-r} = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)\cdots(n + r -1)}{(r - 1)!}
= \frac{n^{r-1}}{(r-1)!}\left(1 + \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)\right).
$$
The standard function scale will generalize this result to arbitrary complex $\alpha$ with the help of special contours of integration, known as *Hankel contours*. The motivation behind them is to come very close to the singularities, but to steer away at the last moment, thus capturing the essential asymptotic information contained in the functions' singularities.

As indicated in the beginning of the section, the standard function scale can be extended to a wider class of functions. We state the corresponding result here without proof and refer the inclined reader to \[[[Singularity analysis of generating functions|Flajolet & Odlyzko, 1990]]\] for a thorough treatment.

In Table [[Table of standard function scale]] we illustrate the asymptotic form of coefficients of the most commonly encountered functions belonging to the standard function scale.

A technical aid to establish the transfer theorems necessary to bound the perturbation in the asymptotics of the coefficients, introduced by error terms in the singular expansions, is the concept of a $\Delta$-domain.

As we indicated at the start of this section, this theorem even holds for a larger class of functions, which the theorem below captures.

A similar proof also shows another variant of the Transfer Theorem.

An immediately corollary of the $\mathcal{O}$- and the $o$-transfer combined is the transfer of asymptotic equivalence from singular forms to coefficients.

We summarize these finding in the following proposition, which describes a procedural approach for applying singularity analysis to a function with a single dominant singularity.

As a first application of the process of singularity analysis we derive the asymptotic behavior of the most famous sequence in combinatorics, the Catalan numbers.

We conclude this section with a helpful tool for the identification of dominant singularities, which was originally formulated by Giulio Vivanti in 1893 and proved by Alfred Pringsheim in 1894. The proof of the so-called Pringsheim Theorem is based on the following lemma, which guarantees the existence of a singular point on the circle of convergence.
