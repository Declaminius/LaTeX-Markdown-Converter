We now start by providing a general formula for the generating function of meanders with (alternative) catastrophes. The structure of the general formula does not change for similar models of catastrophes and thus only slight modifications are necessary to encompass the differences in the two models.

If we let go of the negative image of a catastrophe that pushes the path down to zero and adopt the more neutral point of view as a reset to zero, it makes also sense to look at walks and bridges with resets to zero.

> ![[Resets to zero|no-title]]

Together with Theorem [[Generating function of walks]] and Theorem [[Generating function of bridges and walks ending at altitude k]] we derive an almost analogous result for the generating function of unconstrained walks and bridges with resets to zero.

In the following subsections we present a number of different step sets paired with alternative catastrophes. We derive their generating functions and provide bijections with various combinatorial objects that originate from the OEIS entries corresponding to the respective counting sequences.
