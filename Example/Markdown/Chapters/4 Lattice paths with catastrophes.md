This chapter is rooted in the paper from Banderier and Wallner \[[[Lattice paths with catastrophes|Banderier & Wallner, 2017]]\], where the authors study directed lattice paths, augmented with so-called *catastrophes*, as a model for queues with resets.
Already in 2005 Krinik et al.~\[[[Dual processes to solve single server systems|Krinik et. al., 2005]]\] used Dyck meanders with catastrophes as a model for the classical single server queueing system with a finite capacity M/M/1/H, with a constant catastrophe rate $\gamma$. This allowed them to introduce a new method to determine the transient probability functions of classical queueing theory systems
using lattice path combinatorics.
Further, queues with catastrophes also arise as simple, natural models of the evolution of stock markets \[[[Lévy Processes in Finance Pricing Financial Derivatives|Schoutens, 2003]]\], or under the name of *random walks with resetting* in the field of probability theory and statistical mechanics \[[[First order transition for the optimal search time of Lévy flights with resetting|Kusmierz et. al., 2014]]\].
Since the differing requirements of the diverse applications often call for
adaptations to the simple model of queues with resets, we will compare and contrast two different versions of catastrophes in this chapter. 
As a baseline, Banderier and Wallner, in their article \[[[Lattice paths with catastrophes|Banderier & Wallner, 2017]]\], introduce them as follows:

However, it might also make sense to allow catastrophes, even when they would coincide with regular jumps, as well as catastrophes at height zero.
This conveniently leads to a model that is easier to handle, simplifying some of the more tedious calculations. To distinguish these two models we will refer to catastrophes of the second kind as *alternative catastrophes*.
