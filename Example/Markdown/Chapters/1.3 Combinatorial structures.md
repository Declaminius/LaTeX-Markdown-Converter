> A generating function is a clothesline on which we hang up a sequence of numbers for display. What that means is this: suppose we have a problem whose answer is a sequence of numbers, $a_0,a_1,a_2,\dots$. We want to 'know' what the sequence is. What kind of an answer might we expect?

In this section we introduce the notion of a combinatorial class, together with the powerful symbolic method, based on Chapter I of \[[[Analytic combinatorics|Flajolet & Sedgewick, 2009]]\]. Many general set-theoretic constructions are built directly in terms of simpler classes by means of a collection of elementary combinatorial constructions, namely the operations of union, Cartesian product, sequence, set, multiset and cycle. The symbolic method then provides a dictionary translating these set-theoretic operations into algebraic operations on generating functions. Hence, the task of constructing a generating function of a combinatorial structure reduces to the identification of a formal specification in terms of basic constructions. After this, the translation into generating functions becomes a purely mechanical process.

The fundamental object studied by symbolic enumeration methods is the *combinatorial class*. It serves as a model of sets of discrete objects, like words, trees, graphs, permutations or lattice paths.

Next, for combinatorial enumeration purposes, it proves convenient to identify combinatorial classes that are merely variants of each other.

The symbolic method for describing set-theoretic construction closely resembles the description of formal languages by means of grammars. Specifically, it is based on so-called *admissible constructions* that permit direct translations into generating functions.

In lattice path combinatorics we are often interested in precise quantitative information on probabilistic properties of parameters defined for combinatorial objects. In this case, ordinary generating function are no longer sufficient to keep track of the additional information gained by the introduction of these parameters. 
Hence, just like the formal variable $z$ marks the size of a combinatorial object, we will introduce an additional formal variable for each of the new parameters to fulfill just this role.

We now give a quick overview of all the basic constructions commonly used within the symbolic framework and how they are translated into the language of generating functions.

In simple cases like this it is possible to get a closed-form expression for the counting sequence. With increasing complexity in the combinatorial structures, the challenge of finding closed-form expressions decreases in feasibility, and thus results pertaining the asymptotic growth rates of coefficients gain in importance. To compare the growth rates of sequences, we use the classic Landau (or Big O) notation, invented by the German mathematicians Bachmann^[Paul Gustav Heinrich Bachmann (1837–1920)] and Landau^[Edmund Georg Hermann Landau (1877–1938)].
