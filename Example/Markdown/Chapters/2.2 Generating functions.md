The aim of this section is to present the derivations of the generating functions depicted in Table~[[The four types of directed paths]] in a manner that is easily accessible. Hence, we will present the proofs in the seminal work \[[[Basic analytic combinatorics of directed lattice paths|Banderier & Flajolet, 2002]]\] by Banderier and Flajolet with all necessary calculations being made explicit. 
We begin with the easiest class of lattice paths to analyze. Walks or paths are lattice paths not confined to the upper-right quadrant that may end anywhere. Hence they are only restricted by their step set.

Next, we want to determine the generating function of walks ending at a particular altitude $k$, and in particular, the generating function of bridges. In this proof we will initiate the demonstration on how the complex-analytic framework proves crucially useful to the theory of lattice path enumeration.

We conclude this section with the two short applications of the formula [[gf_excursions]] for the generating function of excursions. In particular, after Example [[André’s reflection principle]] and Example [[Counting sequence of Dyck excursions]], we now give a third distinct derivation of the fact that the number of Dyck excursions of length $2n$ equals the $n$-th Catalan number $C_n$.
