To derive most of these general formulae for the generating functions, the technique of choice will be the so-called *kernel method*. As Banderier and Flajolet note in \[[[Basic analytic combinatorics of directed lattice paths|Banderier & Flajolet, 2002, p.~55]]\], this method has been part of the folklore of combinatorialists for some time.
It deals with a functional equation of the form
$$
K(z,u)F(z,u) = A(z,u) + B(z,u)G(z),
$$
with $F(z,u)$ and $G(z)$ being the unknown functions. The core idea is now to solve the *kernel equation* $K(z,u) = 0$ for $u$. In its simplest form, the equation admits exactly one *small branch* $u_1(z)$ that is characterized by the property that $\lim_{z \to 0} u_1(z) = 0$. In that case, a single substitution does the job, and we get
$$\begin{align*}
G(z) = - \frac{A(z,u_1(z))}{B(z,u_1(z))}, \qquad
F(z,u) = \frac{1}{K(z,u)}\left( A(z,u) - \frac{B(z,u) \cdot A(z,u_1(z))}{B(z,u_1(z))}\right).
\end{align*}$$

Further developments pertaining the kernel method can be found in the article by Bousquet-Mélou and Petkovšek \[[[Linear recurrences with constant coefficients the multivariate case|Bousquet-Mélou & Petkovšek, 2000]]\], concerned with the subject of multi-dimensional walks, linear recurrences and kernels. 
Let us now provide a formal definition for the kernel equation and analyze a few basic properties regarding its solutions.

%%   -  %%
%%   - The asymptotics are coming from the dominant roots $u_1$ and $v_1$, which are singular at $\rho$, the product of the other roots is analytical at $\rho$ and therefore, these other roots only affect the multiplicative constant of the asymptotics. Some easy modifications have to be made here if the walk is "periodic". %%
%%   - The roots $u_1$ and $v_1$ share a square root behavior at $z = \rho$: %%
%%   $$ %%
%%     u_1(z) \sim \tau + \sum_{n = 1}^\infty a_n (\rho - z)^{n/2}, \qquad %%
%%     v_1(z) \sim \tau + \sum_{n = 1}^\infty (-1)^n a_n (\rho - z)^{n/2}. %%
%%   $$ %%
%%   - The drift $\delta := P'(1)$ of the walk plays a role for the asymptotics of meanders ($\delta > 0$ when $\tau > 1; \delta = 0$ when $\tau = 1; \delta < 0$ when $\tau < 1$). %%

Before we proceed with analyzing the most important properties of this characteristic curve, we interject a useful little lemma for Laurent series with non-negative coefficients.

In the following proposition we collect a handful of useful results from \[[[Basic analytic combinatorics of directed lattice paths|Banderier & Flajolet, 2002]]\] by Banderier and Flajolet pertaining the kernel equation.

These properties are vindicated by the classical theory of Newton-Puiseux expansions. For completeness sake, we will state and prove this fundamental result in the elementary theory of algebraic curves that determines constructively all the possible behaviors of solutions of polynomial equations.
