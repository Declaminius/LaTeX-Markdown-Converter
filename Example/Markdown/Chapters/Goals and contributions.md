##### Goals.
Firstly, the necessary groundwork for the analysis of directed lattice paths shall be thoroughly presented, with all necessary derivations made explicit. This includes a detailed treatment of the central *kernel method*, as well as the process of *singularity analysis*.
Secondly, the general formulae and techniques are then applied to specific classes of lattice paths, in particular, *basketball walks* and directed lattice paths with *catastrophes*. Wherever possible, we make lateral connections to different combinatorial objects explicit, by constructing vivid bijections between them.
##### Contributions.
In Chapter [[2 Directed lattice paths and the kernel method]], we collect the often scattered properties of the kernel method, along with their theoretical underpinnings, in the concise Proposition [[Properties of the characteristic curve]].
In Chapter [[3 Basketball walks]], we augment the article by Banderier, Krattenthaler, Krinik, D. Kruchinin, V. Kruchinin, Nguyen and Wallner \[[[Explicit formulas for enumeration of lattice paths basketball and the kernel method|Banderier et. al., 2019]]\] with a novel, combinatorial derivation of a generating function (Proposition [[Proposition 3.1.5]]) and correct several typos in the paper.
In Chapter [[4 Lattice paths with catastrophes]], we expand on the work by Banderier and Wallner \[[[Lattice paths with catastrophes|Banderier & Wallner, 2017]]\], by contrasting their model of catastrophes with a similar alternative suggested in the paper. In this context, we provide multiple new bijections between related families of lattice paths arising from this alternative model in Section [[4.1 Generating functions]] and prove a general result pertaining to the asymptotic growth rates of the number of $k$-Motzkin excursions with alternative catastrophes (Theorem [[Theorem 4.2.11]]).
Finally, in Chapter [[5 Links to other combinatorial problems]], we link the theory of lattice path combinatorics to the field of counting animals via a novel bijective procedure (Theorem [[Theorem 5.1.8]]) mapping Motzkin excursions with alternative catastrophes to the class of stacked directed animals, introduced by Bousquet-Mélou and Rechnitzer in \[[[Lattice animals and heaps of dimers|Bousquet-Mélou & Rechnitzer, 2002]]\].
