Let $G_{j,n,k}$ be the number of positive basketball walks starting at $(0,j)$ and ending at $(n,k)$ for $j,k \geq 0$ and define
$$\begin{equation*}
G_j(z,u) := \sum_{n,k = 0}^\infty G_{j,n,k} z^n u^k
= \sum_{n = 0}^\infty g_{j,n}(u)z^n = \sum_{k = 0}^\infty G_{j,k}(z)u^k.
\end{equation*}$$
We note that this bivariate generating function is analytic for $|z| < 1/P(1)$ and $|u| \leq 1$. Further, the characteristic polynomial is given by
$$
P(u) = u^{-2} + u^{-1} + u + u^2
$$
and thus the kernel equation 
![[kernel_basketball|no-title]]
admits two small roots, $u_1(z)$ and $u_2(z)$, as well as two large roots, $v_1(z)$ and $v_2(z)$.

Equipped with those basic properties we are now ready to apply the kernel method to yet another lattice path enumeration problem.
