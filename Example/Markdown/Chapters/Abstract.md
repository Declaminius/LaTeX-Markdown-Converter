The central mathematical objects of lattice path combinatorics are generating functions.
Initially, we introduce them as formal power series, whose algebraic structure directly reflects the structure of combinatorial classes.
Hence, the logical first step for analyzing any family of lattice paths lies in the derivation of its generating function. 
After identifying a formal specification of this family in terms of basic set-theoretic constructions, the *symbolic method* provides us with a functional equation satisfied by our generating function.
Next, the so-called *kernel method* serves as a powerful tool to solve this often seemingly underdetermined functional equation. 
Once the generating function has been derived, we may continue in three possible directions.
Firstly, in simple cases, it is possible to obtain a closed-form expression for the corresponding counting sequence via a combination of Newton's generalized binomial theorem and Lagrange's inversion formula.
Secondly, an investigation into the nature and location of the complex singularities of the generating function provides vital insights into the asymptotic growth rates of their coefficients, even if a closed-form formula is no longer feasible.
Finally, we use the generating functions in conjunction with the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) to discover connections to related combinatorial structures and construct explicit bijections between them. 
While the equality of the counting sequences guarantees the existence of such a function, the actual construction is often far from obvious.
