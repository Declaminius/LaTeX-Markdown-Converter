In this section we will build up the basic framework necessary for the study of lattice paths, where the notations and definitions are mostly based on the introduction of Wallner's master thesis \[[[Lattice path combinatorics|Wallner, 2013]]\]. We will breathe life into these definitions with classical examples that have been studied since the earliest days of lattice path enumeration.

In Figure [[Figure. Examples of lattices]] we illustrate a few common examples of lattices.
The most important lattice for this thesis will be the Euclidean or square lattice.
In this case, the infinite edge set can be induced by a finite set of steps or jumps, which describe how a path may move from one vertex to the next.

A fascinating part of lattice path combinatorics is the fact that despite their easily accessible definitions, most of their properties still remain unproven or unknown. Hence, most step sets of lattice paths analyzed in this thesis satisfy further restrictions.

Since the steps in simple paths are always of the form $(1,b)$, simple paths are essentially one-dimensional objects. This stands in contrast to step sets including generic steps of the form $(x,y)$, where we do need the whole two-dimensional plane to represent such paths. This reduction in dimensionality allows us to understand simple lattice paths in much greater detail.
In many applications, step sets may be augmented with a system of weights.

With this definition, a central concept in the analysis of linear recurrences can be adapted to the theory of lattice paths.

The field of lattice path enumeration allows for countless connections to other areas of combinatorics. In particular, plane trees are closely related to lattice paths. 
Any plane tree can be traversed starting from the root, proceeding depth-first and left-to-right, and backtracking upwards once a subtree has been completely traversed. 
This order is known as a *preorder* or *prefix order*, since a node is preferentially visited before its children. 
Given a tree, the listing of the outdegrees of nodes in prefix order is called the preorder degree sequence. 
Note that a plane tree can be uniquely determined by its preorder degree sequence. 
For the example tree depicted in Figure [[Subfigure. Plane tree]], the preorder degree sequence reads 
$$
\sigma = (3,1,2,0,0,1,0,2,0,0).
$$
This degree sequence can then be interpreted as a word over a finite alphabet. 
Each value $j$ for the outdegree of a node is represented by a symbol $f_j$. 
Then, after adding parentheses, the word can be interpreted as a functional term, where $f_j$ represents a function of arity $j$. 
In our example this yields the functional term
$$
f_3(f_1(f_2(f_0,f_0)),f_1(f_0),f_2(f_0,f_0)).
$$
Such codes are known as *Łukasiewicz codes* after the polish logician^[Jan Łukasiewicz (1878–1956)] with the same name.
Finally, we make the connection to lattice paths by associating any symbol $f_j$ to the simple step $(1, j - 1)$. 
Then, by starting at the origin and adding steps according to the preorder degree sequence we get a lattice path, associated with a simple step set $\mathcal{S} \subset \{-1,0,1,2,\dots\}$, also known as a *Łukasiewicz walk*.
Further, since every tree satisfies $|E| = |V| - 1$, the lattice path never crosses below the $x$-axis except at the very last step; see Figure [[Subfigure. Łukasiewicz excursion]]. 
Thus, by omitting the last step we get a correspondence between plane trees with $n + 1$ nodes and Łukasiewicz excursions of length $n$ \[[[Analytic combinatorics|Flajolet & Sedgewick, 2009, p.~74–75]]\].

In particular, binary trees are associated in this way to the possibly most famous example of a family of directed lattice paths, named after the German mathematician Dyck^[Walther Franz Anton von Dyck (1856–1934)].

We now present an elementary counting argument to derive the number of Dyck excursions of length $2n$.

As the prime example of lattice path enumeration, it is perhaps not surprising that the enumeration of Dyck paths is intimately connected to the most ubiquitous sequence in combinatorics: the Catalan numbers.
They are named after the Belgian mathematician Catalan^[Eugène Charles Catalan (1814–1894)] , who was the first to obtain today's standard formulae
$$
C_n = \frac{(2n)!}{n!(n+1)!} = \binom{2n}{n} - \binom{2n}{n-1} = \frac{1}{n + 1}\binom{2n}{n}.
$$
The origins of the sequence, however, reach back even further than this. They first appeared in the works of the Mongolian astronomer and mathematician Minggatu^[Sharabiin Myangat (1692–1763)]. In his book *Quick Methods for Accurate Values of Circle Segments* \[[[Quick Methods for Accurate Values of Circle Segments|Myangat]]\], he already obtained the recurrence formula
$$
C_1 = 1, \quad C_2 = 2, \quad C_{n+1} = \sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k \binom{n+1-k}{k+1}C_{n-k}.
$$
In European mathematical circles, Euler^[Leonhard Euler (1707–1783)] was the first one to obtain a closed formula
![[euler_formula|no-title]]
for the Catalan numbers in 1751. A complete proof of this formula, however, was not achieved until 1759 with substantial assistance by Goldbach^[Christian Goldbach (1690–1754)] and Segner^[Johann Andreas von Segner (1704–1777)], the latter of which provided the final missing piece with the recurrence relation
![[segner_recurrence|no-title]]
The study of this sequence then really kicked off with the French School between 1838 and 1843, as Liouville^[Joseph Liouville (1809–1882)] used his large mailing list of mathematicians to communicate the problem of deriving [[euler_formula|Euler's product formula]] from [[segner_recurrence|Segner's recurrence]] to "various geometers", among them the aforementioned Catalan. This fascinating digression into the history of mathematics and many more details can be found in Appendix~B of the monograph on the Catalan numbers \[[[Catalan numbers|Stanley, 2015]]\], contributed by Igor Pak.

For more combinatorial interpretations, the monograph \[[[Catalan numbers|Stanley, 2015]]\] from Richard Stanley lists 214 different kinds of combinatorial objects counted by the Catalan numbers, some of which will reappear at various points throughout this thesis.
