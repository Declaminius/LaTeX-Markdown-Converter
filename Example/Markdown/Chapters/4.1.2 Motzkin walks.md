We recall Motzkin walks to be directed lattice paths with the simple step set $\mathcal{M} = \{-1,0,1\}$. If we use $k$ different colors for the horizontal step, we call the resulting lattice paths $k$-Motzkin walks.
Let us start now with the enumeration of Motzkin meanders with (alternative) catastrophes.

Again, we follow these results up with bijections to related families of lattice paths listed in [$\texttt{OEIS A059738}$](https://oeis.org/A059738).

Further, for the set $\mathcal{M}_n$ of Motzkin meanders of length $n$ with catastrophes, Baril and Kirgizov \[[[Bijections from Dyck and Motzkin meanders with catastrophes to pattern avoiding Dyck paths|Baril & Kirgizov, 2021, Theorem 3]]\] construct a bijection to the set $\mathcal{B}_{n+1}$ of Dyck excursions of length $2n+2$ avoiding the patterns **NE-NE-NE** at height $h \geq 2$.
