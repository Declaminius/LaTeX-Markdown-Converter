This chapter is devoted to the analysis of the four basic types of simple lattice paths; see Table [[The four types of directed paths]].
We begin in Section [[2.1 Kernel method]] with providing a thorough treatment, including its historical developments, of the central technique in the theory of lattice path enumeration: the *kernel method*. 
Following up, in Section [[2.2 Generating functions]] we apply this method to derive general formulae for the generating functions of the four basic types for arbitrary simple step sets. 
The first two sections are mainly based on the seminal article
*Basic analytic combinatorics of directed lattice paths* by Banderier and Flajolet \[[[Basic analytic combinatorics of directed lattice paths|Banderier & Flajolet, 2002]]\].
Further, in Section [[2.3 Singularity analysis]] we present an introduction into the theory of singularity analysis and their application for determining the asymptotic behavior of the counting sequences for directed lattice paths. 
For this part we follow closely the clear presentation in the definite treatment on the topic: 
The monograph *Analytic Combinatorics* by Flajolet and Sedgewick \[[[Analytic combinatorics|Flajolet & Sedgewick, 2009]]\].
