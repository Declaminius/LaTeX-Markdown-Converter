This chapter is based on and extends the work by Banderier, Krattenthaler, Krinik, D. Kruchinin, V. Kruchinin, Nguyen and Wallner in \[[[Explicit formulas for enumeration of lattice paths basketball and the kernel method|Banderier et. al., 2019]]\]. 
In this article, the authors investigate a wide class of lattice paths with symmetric step sets $\{-h,\dots,-1,1,\dots,h\}$. 
For $h = 1$, this corresponds to the classical Dyck paths and $h = 2$ yields the eponymous basketball walks, which will be the main focus of this chapter. 
We derive their generating functions, as well as closed form formulae for the coefficients of the counting sequences and their corresponding asymptotic growth rates. In addition, we present a novel combinatorial derivation of a generating function (Proposition [[Proposition 3.1.5]]) that was previously only accessible via contour integrals and residue calculations.
Further, we will correct some typos in the original paper, which will be highlighted with a footnote.
