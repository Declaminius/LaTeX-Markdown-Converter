A function $h(z)$ is *meromorphic* at $z_{0}$ iff, for $z$ in a neighborhood of $z_{0}$ with $z \neq z_{0}$ it can be represented as a quotient $f(z)/g(z)$ of two analytic functions. In that case, it admits near $z_{0}$ a Laurent series expansion of the form
$$
h(z) = \sum_{n \geq n_0}h_{n}(z-z_{0})^{n}.
$$
If $h_{n_{0}} \neq 0$ and $n_{0} \leq -1$, then $h(z)$ is said to have a pole of order $n_{0}$ at $z=z_{0}$.
A function is meromorphic in a region iff it is meromorphic at every point of the region.
