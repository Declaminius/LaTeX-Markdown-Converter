Consider a simple path with a finite step set $J$. A *reset to zero* is a step of the form $(1, -s)$, with $-s \notin \mathcal{S}$, allowed only at altitude $s$, that resets the path to the $x$-axis.
An *alternative reset to zero* is a step of the form $(1, -s)$, for any $s \in \Z$, allowed only at altitude $s$, that resets the path to the $x$-axis.
