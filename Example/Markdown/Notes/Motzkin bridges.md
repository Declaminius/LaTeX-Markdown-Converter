The generating function $B_{\mathcal{M}}(z) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty b_nz^n$ for Motzkin bridges satisfies
$$
B_{\mathcal{M}}(z) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 2z -  3z^2}} = 1 + z + 3z^2 + 7z^3 + 19z^4 + 51z^5 + 141z^6 + 393z^7 + \mathcal{O}(z^8)
$$ 
and its coefficients $b_n = [u^n](1+u+u^2)^n$ are also known as the
central trinomial numbers; see [$\texttt{OEIS A002426}$](https://oeis.org/A002426).
