Let $G_{1,1}(z)$ be the generating function for positive basketball walks starting and ending at altitude one, also known as basketball excursions. Then, as $n \to \infty$ the coefficients are asymptotically equal to 
$$\begin{align*}
[z^{n}]G_{1,1}(z) &= \frac{6\sqrt{5} - 10}{5\sqrt{\pi}}\frac{4^n}{\sqrt{n^3}}
\left(
1 - \frac{381 - 48\sqrt{5}}{200n} + \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{n^2}\right)
\right)
\end{align*}$$
with $C := \frac{6\sqrt{5} - 10}{5\sqrt{\pi}} \approx 0.38550$.
