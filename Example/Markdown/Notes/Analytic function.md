A function $f(z)$ defined over a region $\Omega$ is *analytic* at a point $z_{0} \in \Omega$ iff, for $z$ in some open disc centered at $z_0$ and contained in $\Omega$, it is representable by a convergent power series expansion
$$
f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_{n}(z-z_{0})^{n}.
$$
A function is analytic in a region $\Omega$ iff it is analytic at every point of $\Omega$.
