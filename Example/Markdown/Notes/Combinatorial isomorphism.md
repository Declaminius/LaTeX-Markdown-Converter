Two combinatorial classes $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ are said to be *combinatorically isomorphic*, iff their counting sequences are identical. In this case, we also write $\mathcal{A} \cong \mathcal{B}$. This condition is equivalent to the existence of a bijection from $\mathcal{A}$ to $\mathcal{B}$ that preserves size. Hence, one also says that $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ are *bijectively equivalent*.
