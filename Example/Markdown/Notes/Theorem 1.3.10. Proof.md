We will provide the proof regarding the sequence construction as an example. The admissibility of this construction follows from the admissibility of the union and product constructions. One has
$$
\mathcal{A} = \{\varepsilon\} + \mathcal{B} + (\mathcal{B} \times \mathcal{B}) + \cdots,
$$
which implies
$$
A(z) = 1 + B(z) + B(z)^2 + \cdots = \frac{1}{1 - B(z)},
$$
where the final equality is to be interpreted as convergence in the formal topology, which we have shown in Example [[Example 1.2.3]].
For a thorough treatment of these combinatorial constructions, the author recommends the treatise in \[[[Analytic combinatorics|Flajolet & Sedgewick, 2009, Section I.2]]\] by Flajolet and Sedgewick.
