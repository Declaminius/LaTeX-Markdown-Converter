A *dimer* consists of two adjacent vertices on a lattice. 
A *heap of dimers* is obtained by dropping a finite number of dimers towards a horizontal axis, where each dimer falls until it either touches the horizontal axis or another dimer. 
The *width* of a heap is the number of non-empty columns. The dimers that touch the $x$-axis are called *minimal*.
A heap is called
- *strict*, if no dimer has another dimer directly above it;
- *connected*, if its orthogonal projection on the horizontal axis is connected;
- a *pyramid*, if it has only one minimal dimer;
- a *half-pyramid*, if its only minimal dimer lies in the rightmost non-empty column.
The *right width* of a pyramid is the number of non-empty columns to the right of the minimal dimer with the *left width* being defined symmetrically.
Note that pyramids and half-pyramids are always connected.
These definitions are illustrated in Figure [[Figure. Heaps of dimers]].
