*Basketball walks* are simple lattice paths constructed from the step set $\{-2,-1,1,2\}$. The name refers to the evolution of the score during a basketball game before the introduction of the 3-point rule.
*Positive basketball walks* are basketball meanders staying strictly above the $x$-axis, possibly touching it at the first or last step.
