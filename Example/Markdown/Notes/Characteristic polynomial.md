The *characteristic polynomial* or *jump polynomial* of a simple step set $\mathcal{S} \subset \mathbb{Z}$ is defined as the Laurent polynomial
$$
P(u) = \sum_{s \in \mathcal{S}} p_s u^s,
$$
where $p_s > 0$ is the weight associated to the step $s \in \mathcal{S}$.
If we define $c = - \min(\mathcal{S})$ and $d = \max(\mathcal{S})$ as the two extremal vertical amplitudes of any jump, it is often convenient to rewrite the jump polynomial to
$$
P(u) = \sum_{k = -c}^d p_k u^k,
$$
with the convention that $p_k = 0$ if $k \notin \mathcal{S}$.
