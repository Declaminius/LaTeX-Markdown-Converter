In most cases pertaining to lattice path combinatorics it suffices to consider a single scalar parameter $\chi$, usually encoding the final height of a lattice path. This way, we obtain a *bivariate generating function (BGF)*
$$
A(z,u) = \sum_{n,k = 0}^\infty a_{n,k} u^k z^n,
$$
with $z$ marking the length of the path and $u$ marking the final height (or an alternative parameter).
