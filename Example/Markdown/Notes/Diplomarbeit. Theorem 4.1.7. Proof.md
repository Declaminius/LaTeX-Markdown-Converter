Let $\omega_M$ be a Motzkin meander of length $n-1$ with alternative catastrophes. We now construct a Motzkin excursion $\omega_E$ with symmetric arches of length $2n$. We start by drawing the first obligatory **NE**-step of $\omega_E$ and continue adding the steps of $\omega_M$ to $\omega_E$ until the first catastrophe occurs. Each catastrophe signals the start of a new symmetric arch. Thus, we complete the current arch by mirroring all previous steps, before we map the catastrophe to the first **NE**-step of the new arch.
Now we iterate this process until all arches have been drawn.
To construct the inverse mapping we simply take the first halves of each symmetric arch and replace the first **NE**-step each with an alternative catastrophe, except for the first arch, where the alternative catastrophe is omitted. This procedure is illustrated in Figure~[[Figure. Bijection involving Motzkin meanders with alternative catastrophes]].
