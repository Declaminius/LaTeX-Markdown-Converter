The number of $n$-celled stacked directed animals on the square and triangular lattice, respectively, is asymptotically equal to
$$\begin{equation*}
s_n = \frac{3}{28} \left(\frac{7}{2}\right)^n\left(1 + \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)\right), \qquad
t_n = \frac{1}{12} \left(\frac{9}{2}\right)^n\left(1 + \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)\right).
\end{equation*}$$
The number of minimal dimers in the corresponding stacked pyramids, which is a lower bound on their width, is asymptotically equal to $\frac{3}{28}n$ and $\frac{1}{12}n$, respectively. The width is trivially bounded above by $n$.
