The set of strict pyramids of size $n+1$ is in bijection with the set of 2-Motzkin excursions of length $n$ (with black and red **E**-steps), such that no red {\color{catred}**E**}-step occurs at positive height $h > 0$.
Equivalently, we could describe it as the set of Motzkin excursions of length $n$ with catastrophes only occurring at height $h = 0$.
