Let $f(z)$ be a branch of an algebraic function $P(z,f(z)) = 0$. In a circular neighborhood of a singularity $\zeta$, slit along a ray emanating from $\zeta$, the function $f(z)$ admits a fractional series expansion, called a *Puiseux series*, that is locally convergent and of the form $$ f(z) = \sum\limits_{k \geq k_{0}} c_{k}(z - \zeta)^{k/\kappa},$$
for a fixed determination of $(z - \zeta)^{1/\kappa}$, where $k_{0} \in \Z$ and $\kappa \in \N_{\geq 1}$.
