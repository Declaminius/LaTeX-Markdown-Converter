Consider a simple path with a finite step set $\mathcal{S}$. A *catastrophe* is a step of the form $(1, -s)$, with $-s \notin \mathcal{S}$ and $s > 0$, allowed only at altitude $s$, that takes the path immediately down to the $x$-axis. We denote the weight of a catastrophe with $q$. Note that, with this definition catastrophes can never coincide with regular jumps.
