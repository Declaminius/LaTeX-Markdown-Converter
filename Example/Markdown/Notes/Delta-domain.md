Given two numbers $\phi, R$ with $R > 1$ and $0 < \phi < \frac{\pi}{2}$, the open \textit{$\Delta$-domain} $\Delta(\phi,R)$ at one is defined as 
$$
\Delta(\phi,R) = \{\, z : |z| < R, z \neq 1, |\arg(z - 1)| > \phi \,\}.
$$
For a complex number $\zeta \neq 0$, a $\Delta$-domain at $\zeta$ is the image by the mapping $z \mapsto \zeta z$ of a $\Delta$-domain at 1. A function is $\Delta$-analytic if it is analytic in some $\Delta$-domain.
