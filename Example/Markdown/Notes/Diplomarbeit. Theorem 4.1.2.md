The set of Dyck meanders with alternative catastrophes of length $n$ is in bijection with the set of 2-Motzkin excursions of length $n$, with no **E**-steps at positive heights $h > 0$.
%% In addition, the set of Dyck paths (excursions) with alternative catastrophes of length $n$ is in bijection with the set of 2-Motzkin excursions with no **E**-steps at positive height with no **E**-steps at positive height ending with a red {\color{catred} **E**}-step or a **SE**-step with the additional requirement that the number of blue {\color{lightblue} **E**}-steps since the last red {\color{catred} **E**}-step equals the number of **SE**-steps since then. %%
