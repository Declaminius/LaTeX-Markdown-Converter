A function $f\colon \Omega \to \C$, defined on an open set $\Omega \subset \C$ is complex differentiable at $z_{0} \in U$ iff the limit
$$
f'(z_{0}) := \lim_{z \to z_{0}} \frac{f(z) - f(z_{0})}{z - z_{0}}
$$
exists. The function $f$ is called *holomorphic* in $\Omega$ iff it is complex differentiable at every point of $\Omega$.
