The bivariate generating function of meanders ($z$ marking size and $u$ marking final altitude) relative to a simple step set $\mathcal{S}$ with characteristic polynomial $P(u)$, is an algebraic function. It is given by

In particular, the generating function of excursions, $E(z) = M(z,0)$ satisfies
