It was observed by Viennot in \[[[Problèmes combinatoires posés par la physique statistique|Viennot, 1985]]\] that this mapping induces a bijection between directed animals on the square (triangular) lattice and strict (general) pyramids of dimers and we denote the inverse mapping by $\overline{V}$.
This can be easily verified by recalling that any vertex in $D$ lies on a directed path consisting only of **N** and **E** steps from the source, visiting only other vertices in $D$. 
Hence, the corresponding dimer in $V(D)$ lies on a directed path of dimers lying diagonally to the left or the right above each other. 
In the case of directed animals on the triangular lattice, the additional possible direction translates to dimers lying directly above each other.
As the next definition will show, it only takes a small adaptation to extend this mapping to general lattice animals.
