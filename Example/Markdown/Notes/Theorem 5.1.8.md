The set of Motzkin excursions with alternative catastrophes of length~$n$ is in bijection with the set of stacked directed animals of size $n +1$ on the square grid.
Furthermore, the set of 2-Motzkin excursions (with black and blue **E**-steps) with alternative catastrophes of length $n$ is in bijection with the set of stacked directed animals of size $n + 1$ on the triangular grid.
