The number of meanders with catastrophes $m_n$ is asymptotically equal to
![[meanders_asymptotics|no-title]]
Note that the only difference to Theorem [[Asymptotics of excursions with catastrophes]] is the appearance of $M(z)$ instead of $E(z)$, and a factor $1/(\tau - 1)$ instead of $1/\tau$ in the first term, when $\mathcal{Z}$ is empty.
