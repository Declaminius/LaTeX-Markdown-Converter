Let $\alpha \in \R$ be an arbitrary real number and let $f(z)$ be a function that is $\Delta$-analytic. 
Assume that $f(z)$ satisfies in the intersection of a neighborhood of one with its $\Delta$-domain the condition   
$$
f(z) = \mathcal{O}\left((1-z)^{-\alpha}\right).
$$
Then it holds that $[z^n]f(z) = \mathcal{O}(n^{\alpha-1}).$
