The generating function $B_{\mathcal{D}}(z) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty b_n z^n$ for Dyck bridges satisfies 
$$
B_{\mathcal{D}}(z) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 -  4z^2}} = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \binom{2n}{n} z^{2n}.
$$
Its coefficients $b_n$ are also known as the central binomial numbers, see [$\texttt{OEIS A000984}$](https://oeis.org/A000984)^[Such references are links to the web-page by N. J. A. Sloane dedicated to the corresponding sequence in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, \url{https://oeis.org}.].
