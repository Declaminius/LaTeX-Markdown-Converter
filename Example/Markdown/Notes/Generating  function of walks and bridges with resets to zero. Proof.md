Theorem: "[[Generating  function of walks and bridges with resets to zero]]"

Again, any arbitrary walk can be decomposed into a final walk without any resets to zero, which we count via $W(z,u)$ and a possibly empty initial part counted by $D(z)$. The formula for the generating function of walks $W(z,u)$ comes from Theorem [[Generating function of walks]].
The initial part now consists of a sequence of walks ending with a catastrophe, instead of meanders.
Hence, we simply replace all generating functions for meanders with their corresponding counterparts for walks and we obtain the claimed formulae.
For the generating function of walks ending at a fixed altitude $k$, we refer to Theorem [[Generating function of bridges and walks ending at altitude k]].
