The set of Dyck meanders with alternative catastrophes of length $n$ is bijectively equivalent to the set of Dyck excursions with symmetric arches of length $2(n+1)$. 
In addition, the set of Dyck excursions with alternative catastrophes is bijectively equivalent to the set of Dyck excursions with symmetric arches of length $2(n+1)$, where the midpoint of the last arch happens to be at height one.
