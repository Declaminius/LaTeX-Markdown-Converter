Take a connected heap $H$ with $k$ minimal dimers. Let us denote by $P_1,P_2,\dots,P_k$, from left to right, the corresponding pyramidal factors of $H$ from the construction in Definition [[Multi-directed animals]]. Let us call *stacked pyramids* the connected heaps such that for $2 \leq i \leq k$, the horizontal projection of $P_i$ intersects the horizontal projection of $P_{i-1}$. Then, *stacked directed animals* are defined as the image of the set of stacked pyramids under $\overline{V}$.
We define the *right width* of a stacked pyramid to be the right width of its rightmost pyramidal factor.
