The OGF corresponding to unrestricted Dyck walks considered in Example [[Number of Dyck walks]] henceforth satisfies
$$
W_\mathcal{D}(z) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty 2^n z^n = \frac{1}{1 - 2z}.
$$
Note that at this point $\frac{1}{1 - 2z}$ is just a shorthand notation for the corresponding formal power series and we are not yet concerned with its analytic properties like convergence.
