Let $u_{1}(z)$ and $u_{2}(z)$ be the small roots of the kernel equation. Then, for $k \geq j > 0$, we have^[The formula in \[[[Explicit formulas for enumeration of lattice paths basketball and the kernel method|Banderier et. al., 2019, Proposition 6.3]]\] incorrectly includes the summand corresponding to $i = 0$.]
