Let $\mathcal{S} = \{s_1,\dots,s_m\}$ be a simple step set with a corresponding system of weights $\Pi = \{\, p_s\mid s \in \mathcal{S} \,\}$ and let $c = - \min_j s_j$ and $d = \max_j s_j$ be the two extreme vertical amplitudes of any jump. Throughout this section we will assume $c, d > 0$, as well as $p_s > 0$, for $s \in \mathcal{S}$. Further, let 
$$
P(u) = \sum_{k=-c}^d p_k u^k
$$ 
be the matching jump polynomial.
Then we define the *kernel equation* for $(\mathcal{S},\Pi)$ as 
$$\begin{equation*}
K(z,u) := 1 - zP(u) = 0,
\end{equation*}$$
where $K(z,u)$, or equivalently $u^c - z(u^cP(u)) = 0$ (as an entire function without negative powers) is called the *kernel*. 
The kernel equation then defines the so-called *characteristic curve* of the family of lattice paths with step set $\mathcal{S}$.
