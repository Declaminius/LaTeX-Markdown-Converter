*Directed paths* are lattice paths on the two-dimensional Euclidean lattice with a fixed direction of increase which we choose to be the positive horizontal axis. This is described by the allowed steps: If $(i,j) \in \mathcal{S}$, then $i > 0.$ 
This implies that the geometric realization of the path always lives in the right half-plane $\mathbb{Z}_+ \times \mathbb{Z}$.
Further, for any given step set $\mathcal{S}$ we commonly distinguish four subclasses of directed paths.
- *Walks/paths* are directed paths that
	- are **not** constrained to stay above the $x$-axis,
	- may end at any altitude.
- *Bridges* are directed paths
	- that are **not** constrained to stay above the $x$-axis,
	- whose endpoint $\omega_n$ lies on the $x$-axis.
- *Meanders* are directed paths that
	- are constrained to stay above the $x$-axis,
	- may end at any altitude.
- *Excursions* are directed paths
	- that are constrained to stay above the $x$-axis,
	- whose endpoint $\omega_n$ lies on the $x$-axis.
