The number of $n$-celled directed animals on the square and the triangular lattice, respectively, is asymptotically equal to
$$\begin{equation*}
s_n = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3\pi}}\frac{3^n}{\sqrt{n}}\left(1 + \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)\right), \qquad
t_n = \frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi}}\frac{4^n}{\sqrt{n}}\left(1 + \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)\right).
\end{equation*}$$
Their average width is asymptotically equal to $6\sqrt{3\pi n}$ and $16\sqrt{\pi n}$, respectively.
