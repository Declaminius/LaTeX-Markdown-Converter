Consider an arbitrary Dyck meander $\omega_M$ with alternative catastrophes of length $n$. We will now construct a Dyck excursion $\omega_E$ with symmetric arches of length $2(n+1)$.
In any case we have to draw the first obligatory **NE**-step in $\omega_E$.
After that we will identify every step in $\omega_M$ with the first half of each symmetric arch of $\omega_E$.
Further, we identify every catastrophe in $\omega_M$ with the first **NE**-step at the start of a new arch.
In particular, if $\omega_M$ starts with a catastrophe, this translates to $\omega_E$ starting with the minimal arch of size two, immediately succeeded by the next arch. 
Then, after drawing the first **NE**-step of the arch, every regular step between two catastrophes gets mapped to the first half of the symmetric arch.
The inverse is easily constructed by reading these steps backwards; see Figure [[Figure. Bijection between Dyck meanders with alternative catastrophes and 2-Motzkin excursions with no E-ste]]
