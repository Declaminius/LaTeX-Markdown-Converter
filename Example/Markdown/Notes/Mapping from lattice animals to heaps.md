Let $\mathcal{A}$ denote the class of lattice animals on the square (triangular) lattice, $\mathcal{H}$ the class of connected heaps and
let $A \in \mathcal{A}$ be a directed lattice animal. 
We now define a mapping $V: \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{H}$ as follows:
1. Rotate $A$ by $45^\circ$ degrees counter-clockwise, if $A$ is an animal on the square grid.
2. Replace each individual cell in $A$ by a dimer.
3. Let the dimers fall.
We call the resulting heap $V(A)$; see Figure [[Constructing a connected heap from a square lattice animal]] for an example of this procedure.
