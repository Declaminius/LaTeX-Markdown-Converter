A *directed animal* on the square grid is a lattice animal, where one vertex has been designated the *source* and all other vertices are connected to the source via a directed path consisting only of **N**- and **E**-steps, and visiting only vertices belonging to the animal.
On the triangular grid, one similarly defines the three possible directions of increase to be **NW**, **N**, and **NE**.
