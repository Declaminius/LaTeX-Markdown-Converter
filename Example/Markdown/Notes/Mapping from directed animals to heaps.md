Let $\mathcal{D}_A$ denote the class of directed lattice animals on the square (triangular) lattice, let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of strict (general) pyramids and let $D \in \mathcal{D}_A$ be a directed lattice animal. 
We now define a mapping $V \colon \mathcal{D}_A \to \mathcal{P}$ as follows:
1. Rotate $D$ by $45^\circ$ degrees counter-clockwise, if $D$ is an animal on the square grid.
2. Replace each individual cell in $D$ by a dimer.
This results in a pyramid $V(D)$ with the source of the lattice animal being the only minimal dimer; see Figure [[Figure. Constructing pyramids from directed lattice animals]].
