Let $\alpha, \beta \in \R$ be arbitrary real numbers and let $f(z)$ be a function that is $\Delta$-analytic. 
Assume that $f(z)$ satisfies in the intersection of a neighborhood of one with its $\Delta$-domain the condition 
$$
f(z) = o\left((1-z)^{-\alpha} \left(\log \frac{1}{1-z}\right)^\beta\right)
$$
Then it holds that $[z^n]f(z) = o(n^{\alpha-1}(\log n)^\beta).$
