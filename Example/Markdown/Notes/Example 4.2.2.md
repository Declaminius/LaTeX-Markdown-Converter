The generating function for Dyck excursions $E_\mathcal{D}(z) = \frac{1 - \sqrt{1 - 4z^{2}}}{2z^{2}}$ is periodic with period $\mathrm{per}(E_\mathcal{D}) = 2$. This corresponds to the fact there are no Dyck excursions of odd length; see Figure [[Figure. All vertices accessible from the origin by Dyck excursions of length 10]].
